# OpenWRT_Mesh
OpenWRT based 802.11s mesh running on RPi. 

Based pretty heavily on the work done by the guys at ATAK HQ  https://atakhq.com/en/manet/openwrt
Gives data access to ATAK in excess of what is available with the Meshtastic forwarder plugin.
Have successfully send location, markers, test and pictures through ATAK with this hardware. The built in ICE plugin for voice also works, but I have not purchased the licesnes to do any extended testing
Currently I have not found an integrated voice solution.
